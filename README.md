# nutra-mock
The "nutra-mock" module is a mocking library for the "[N.U.T.R.A.](https://github.com/m-a-r-c-e-l-i-n-o/nutra)" unit test runner. Currently, it allows for mocking of all global imports and constants in the main execution context of a valid ES6 module file. It does this by statically analyzing the file and transforms the relevant globals in the deeper contexts into objects whose properties can be changed at any time â€” essentially allowing you to mock just about anything!

**This is working, but do to time constraits, it's still lacking.**
**Known issues:**
- The file sources is being modified, but no sourcemaps are being generated at the moment. Expect your debugging to be a bit skewed.
- There cannot be deep context or object declarations with the same variable names as the globals, this will screw things up. To get around this, try making the global variable
names unique on the page (i.e. maybe capitilize them all?).
- This whole thing is still fairly experimental, put together with some minor ast tree crawling and regexes. It really needs to be all ast manipulations, both for performance and reliability. Expect these bugs to be taken care of if this approach turns out to be a reasonable idea.


## Installation
```bash
npm install --save-dev nutra nutra-mock
```

## Add Plugin Configuration:
Create a "nutra.config.js" config file in the root of your project and populate it with the following:
```js
// nutra.config.js
module.exports = function( config ) {
  config.set({
    frameworks: ['nutra-jasmine'],
    files: ['specs/**/*.js', 'src/**/*.js'], // Modify to include your own app & spec files
    preprocessors: {
        'src/**/*.js': ['nutra-mock', 'nutra-babel'] // Modify to include your own app files
    }
  })
  // For more configuration options, please take a look at:
  // https://github.com/m-a-r-c-e-l-i-n-o/nutra#configuration-anatomy
}
```

## Usage
In your scripts:
```js
import Path from 'path'

const Foo = () => {
    Path.join('hello', 'world') // This will be made available for mocking
    return Path
}

const Bar = () => Foo // This will also be made available for mocking

export default Foo
export { Bar }
```
In your tests:
```js
import Path from 'path'
import Foo, { Bar } from '../../src/foo.js'

const Mock = NutraMock.getEntry('./src/some-file.js') // Path is relative to cwd

describe ('Foo', () => {
    it ('should initially not mock Foo\'s "Path" dependency', () => {
        expect(Foo()).toBe(Path) // The native "path" module
    })
    it ('should eventually mock Foo\'s "Path" dependency', () => {
        const mockPath = {
            join: (one, two) => {
                expect(one).toBe('hello')
                expect(two).toBe('world')
            }
        }
        Mock.set('Path', mockPath)
        expect(Foo()).toBe(mockPath) // The "mockPath" object
    })
    it ('should inevitably unmock Foo\'s "Path" dependency', () => {
        Mock.reset('Path')
        expect(Foo()).toBe(Path) // The native "path" module
    })
})

describe ('Bar', () => {
    it ('should initially not mock Bar\'s "Foo" dependency', () => {
        expect(Bar()).toBe(Foo) // The original "Foo" method
    })
    it ('should eventually mock Bar\'s "Foo" dependency', () => {
        const mockFoo = () => {}
        Mock.set('Foo', mockFoo)
        expect(Bar()).toBe(mockFoo) // The "mockFoo" method
    })
    it ('should inevitably unmock Bar\'s "Foo" dependency', () => {
        Mock.reset('Foo')
        expect(Bar()).toBe(Foo) // The original "Foo" method
    })
})
```
